<h1>Problem Statement</h1>

<p>Many people in their day to day life needs some legal assistance but all they got is websites like quora or some other webistes to resolve their queries. </p>
<strong>BUT ARE THESE PLATFORM ENOUGH?</strong>
<p>So we build a law web app which have community feature where everyone can post their queries. You can also hire a personal lawyer to help with your queries. In addditional to this, we have also added a chat bot features. Users can chat with the bot which answers law related queries. </p>

<h2>File Descriptions</h2>

```App.jsx```
<p>First app.jsx opens up the login page where user can log in to their account and it also have a register page. This register page registers the user information in firebase which is later retrieved in checked while the user logs in. </p>

```About.jsx```
